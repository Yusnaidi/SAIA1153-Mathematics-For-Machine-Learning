A program to apply the top k numbers of eigenvectors to images with the purpose
to reconstruct the images with reduced file size and pixel dimensions. This approach
may benefit the application of machine vision in a low-memory and low-processing devices
such as raspberry Pi, Arduino board, or NVIDIA Jetson Nano.</br>
